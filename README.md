### MUSIC GENRE CLASSIFICATION WITH MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES

This project uses machine learning to identify the genre of music files. It works by analyzing audio features extracted from music tracks and training a model to recognize different music styles.

### INFORMATION ABOUT THE REPOSITORY

- config.py file includes some properties like dataset directory, test directory and some properties for signal processing and feature extraction.
- CreateDataset.py file is used for feature extraction and creating dataset.
- ModelTrain.py file is used for creating and training a model.
- GenreRecognition.py file is for predicting the genres of test music files.
- CreateThenTrain.py file runs CreateDataset.py and ModelTrain.py sequentially.
